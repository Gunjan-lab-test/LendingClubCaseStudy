## General Information
- This project focuses on a leading online loan marketplace that offers personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical procedures. The platform allows borrowers to access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
- The business problem addressed is the significant credit loss incurred by lending to risky applicants. Credit loss occurs when borrowers default on their loans, particularly those labeled as 'charged-off.'
- The dataset used contains complete loan data for all loans issued between 2007 and 2011, which provides insights into the factors contributing to loan defaults.

## Conclusions
* Loan Grades: Higher grades have lower rates; lower grades carry higher risk and amounts.
* Home Ownership: Mortgaged or rental borrowers often show higher risk; fully-owned homes indicate lower risk.
* Verification: Verified incomes align with higher grades; unverified incomes increase default risk.
* Loan Purpose: Debt consolidation loans are risky and often low-grade.
* Delinquencies: Recent delinquencies correlate with higher defaults and lower grades.
* Public Records: Negative records lead to lower grades and increased defaults.
